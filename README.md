The go files in this repo are generated by running [miku / zek](https://github.com/miku/zek) against our various EAD sets.
This generated Go code is useful for analysis of the structural characteristics of the EAD files taken as a whole.
Zek creates code that is capable of parsing every single EAD file in the set it was given.
All possible structural variations in the set of EAD files are accommodated by the resulting Go code.

[published-finding-aids-ead-files.go](published-finding-aids-ead-files.go)
is generated from https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads.

[sample-set-1-ead-files.go](sample-set-1-ead-files.go) is generated from https://github.com/NYULibraries/dlts-finding-aids-ead-sample-set-1.

To refresh the *.go files:

```shell
./generate-zek-files.sh
```

You must first have Go and the zek package installed.
To install Go, download and install from https://golang.org/dl/.
To install the zek package:
